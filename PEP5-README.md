2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

PERSONAL NOTES:

I at first tried to solve this using a 'while' loop to test if all the numbers being looped through were NOT divisible by all primes 1-20, but that did not work for whatever reason. I decided to use a normal 'for' loop after that. I declared a counter (i) starting at 2, (looking back, for no apparent reason) and looped one by one. I embedded an if statement within the for loop to test if the numbers were divisible by all numbers 1-20, and told it to print the result. Once the result had been printed, I used a break statement to break the loop (so you don't break your computer).

Using my code you find that the answer is 232,792,560
